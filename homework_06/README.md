# Homework 06
This homework is built on top of `homework 05`, which include back-end development. Instead of using temporary data like previous homework, this one is using `Database` to store all information so that when the server stops running, the data is not lost. 
## Requirement
Make sure you have `NodeJS`, `ExpressJS`, and `Pug` installed.
- First, make sure you're in the project folder  
- To install `node`, run the following command:
    ```
    npm init
    ```
- To install `ExpressJS`, run the following command:
    ```
    npm install express
    ```
- To install `Pug`, run the following command:
    ```
    npm install pug
    ```
- Other requirements are documented in the files

## Get It to Work
- Go to project folder, then run command:
    ```
    node server.js
    ```
- On your browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:4131
    ```
